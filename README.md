# JumpingDuke

## 25 Anniversary Edition

It's a piece of ancient technology that I've discovered in my archives.

Because it's been 25 years since its creation, I gave it a go and ported it to modern times using the web's latest bells and whistles like React + TypeScript + PixiJS.

It was originally developed as a [Java applet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet)

Duke is a [Java mascot](https://dev.java/duke/)

The game was my very loose attempt at the ZX Spectrum's game [Jumping Jack](https://archive.org/details/zx_Jumping_Jack_1983_Imagine_Software_a_16K)

Original source code here: [JumpingDuke.java](JumpingDuke.java) *(just for fun)*
